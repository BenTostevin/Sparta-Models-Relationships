# Sparta Models Relationships

## Description

This project contains three different resources (countries, cities and football teams) and contains data for each of the three resources.

The data for the countries and cities resources were entered manually, whereas the data for the football teams' resource was entered using a seed file.

The countries and cities resources were treated as a one-to-many relationship, as a city can only have one country, but a country can have many cities.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to introduce me to Active Record associations and teach me how to navigate the rails console.
